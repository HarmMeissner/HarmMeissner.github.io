## About

Hi, TEA-Team

This site is set up as required for the application at tech expert academy.

I studied philosophy and cultural studies in the past. Currently I am enrolled at the law department of the Humboldt-University Berlin.
Until I'll be ready to decide upon which interests to pursue wholeheartedly - if any of the aforementioned - I'd like to embrace the one for computers, which I've always had. In recent years I sat down with textbooks trying to understand what happens on a more basic level when, for instance, a simple program is being excecuted on a computer. Or, how packages are sent from one computer to another via what's called the internet. I failed to come far. Especially due to the lack of any practical purpose of my efforts or the amount of time necessary to dig that deep.
I now realize that it would be much more instructive to jump in the middle of things, i.e. getting my hands "dirty". I grew up with computers in the 90s, the last time I - if you will - coded (except for some bash scripts in more recent times) was for a website in 2000. 

Also, I would like to enjoy the advantages of the jobs this world offers: they're well-paid and you can work from any place.

I am looking forward to hear from you.

Greetings

Harm
